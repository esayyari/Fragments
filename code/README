Your **rooted** input gene trees should be in files:
*/raxmlboot.????/RAxML_bipartitions.final.rooted
The first directory gives the type of gene tree you have (e.g., FAA, FNA, etc). 
The second level directories correspond to genes.
Don't forget to first root your gene trees.

Your gene trees with low support branches contracted should be in:
\*/raxmlboot.????/RAxML\_bipartitions.final.rooted.75
 To remove branches below a threshold, you can use any code, including my script called
remove\_edges\_from_tree.py
which requires dendropy 3.12


Then your clade definitions should be in clade-defs.txt. See example for format. 
One taxon from each clade in Components section should be present for the clade to be scored. 

names.csv should simply have the name of all the taxa in your gene trees

Run redo-gt.sh
Use depict_clades_2.R to draw graphs
